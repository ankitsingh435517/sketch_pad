# sketch_pad
It is a simple but fun to do sketch pad
so here by default you have pen selected and you can 
choose for color also 
eraser to erase and a clear button for clearing all.

range slider for the grid dimension in square.

// logic behid and built
so it is built over DOM , events and basic css.

here the bigger problem was to create event handlers on max grid size which is (64 x 64).
therefore try solving smaller problem like only (1 x 1) box gid.

also tried to cut alot of css tricks and rather used programing logic in javascript.
